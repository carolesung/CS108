In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends at fitrec for which you can find more information <a href="https://www.bu.edu/fitrec/">here</a>. I am also involved in a cultural organization named Taiwanese American Student Association (BUTASA) for which you can find more information <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Boston.TASA/">here</a>. With the rest of my free time, I play League of Legends with my friends. However, I got boosted to plat so I'm actually not very good.
